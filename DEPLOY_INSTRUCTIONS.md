# ðŸš€ Super Simple Deployment Instructions

## You have 2 options (both easy!):

---

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended - $5/month)
**This will put your scraper online so your team can use it**

### Step 1: Sign up for Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub (easiest)

### Step 2: Deploy with One Click
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo" 
3. Choose your repo (or I can help you upload)
4. Railway does everything else!

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, go to Variables and add:
```
WEBSHARE_API_KEY=hiya2vn2k5mx5lahgl4aexfvto34gf3jx0ehq3ms
API_KEY=create-a-password-here
```

**That's it! Your scraper will be live at something like:**
`web-scraper.up.railway.app`

---

## Option 2: Keep it Local (Free but only on your computer)

Just run this whenever you want to use it:
```bash
cd /Users/skipmatheny/Documents/cursor2/vibecoding_gemini_claude/projects/web-scraper
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

## ðŸŽ¯ What Your Team Can Do With This:

### From the Web Interface:
1. Go to your Railway URL
2. Enter any website URL
3. Choose where to save (CSV, Google Sheets, Database)
4. Click "Scrape"
5. Data is saved automatically!

### From Code (for your devs):
```javascript
// In their JavaScript/Node.js apps
fetch('https://your-app.railway.app/api/scrape', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://example.com',
    destination: 'csv'
  })
})
```
