# **Optimized Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Internal Web Scraping & Data Integration Platform (2025)**

### **1. Introduction & Vision**

This document outlines the requirements for an internal platform designed to extract public data from websites and APIs. The vision is to create a centralized, user-friendly tool that empowers non-technical teams to gather data independently while providing developers with robust API access for integration with other internal systems. The platform will prioritize ease of use, data integrity, and operational transparency, ensuring all activities are compliant with legal and ethical standards.

### **2. User Personas**

* **Data Analyst Dana:** Needs to frequently pull data from various sources for market research reports. She is comfortable with spreadsheets but not with coding. Her primary goal is to get clean data into Google Sheets or a database as quickly as possible.  
* **Developer Dave:** Works on various internal projects that require data from external sources. He needs a reliable API to programmatically trigger scraping jobs and receive the data via a webhook to continue his application's workflow.  
* **Marketing Manager Mike:** Wants to track competitor pricing and product updates. He needs to be able to set up a recurring scraping job once and have the data delivered to him without further intervention.

### **3. Functional Requirements (User Stories)**

#### **Core Scraping**

* **As a user,** I want to scrape data from both static (simple HTML) and dynamic (JavaScript-heavy) websites so that I can gather information from a wide range of sources.  
* **As a user,** I want the tool to automatically handle common anti-bot measures (proxies, user agents, CAPTCHAs) so that my scraping jobs are successful.

#### **User Experience & Workflow**

* **As Dana,** I want to save a set of scraping configurations as a "Recipe" (template) so that I can re-run common jobs with a single click.  
* **As any user,** I want to see a "Job Dashboard" that shows the status (In Progress, Success, Failed) of all my scraping tasks and provides simple error messages if a job fails.  
* **As Mike,** I want to schedule a Recipe to run on a recurring basis (e.g., daily, weekly) so that I can automate data collection.  
* **As a user,** I want to see a cost estimate before running a large job so that I can manage my budget for proxies and other services.

#### **Data Destinations & Integration**

* **As Dana,** I want to choose where my scraped data is sent, with options for:  
  * A downloadable **CSV file**.  
  * A specific **Google Sheet**.  
  * A **PostgreSQL database** table.  
* **As Developer Dave,** I want to trigger a scraping job by sending a POST request to a secure /api/scrape endpoint so that I can integrate scraping into my applications.  
* **As Developer Dave,** I want to provide a webhook_url when I start a job via the API, so my application receives a notification with the data as soon as the job is complete.

### **4. Non-Functional Requirements**

| Requirement | Description | Metric |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Performance** | Efficiently process large datasets. | 100 pages in under 5 minutes. |
| **Reliability** | The system should have high uptime. | 99.5% uptime for the UI and API. |
| **Security** | Protect organizational systems, user credentials, and target websites. | No critical vulnerabilities detected during security audits. |
| **Scalability** | Handle increased data volumes or concurrent jobs. | Support 10 concurrent jobs without performance degradation. |
| **Usability** | The interface must be intuitive for non-technical users. | A new user can successfully run their first scraping job in under 10 minutes. |

### **5. Technical Requirements**

* **Backend:** Python with Flask (for UI and API).  
* **Scraping Libraries:** requests, BeautifulSoup4, Selenium/Playwright.  
* **Data Destinations:**  
  * Google Sheets: gspread, oauth2client.  
  * Database: psycopg2-binary (for PostgreSQL).  
* **API & Webhooks:** Background jobs managed with a task queue like Celery & Redis to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.  
* **Proxy Services:** Integration with residential/mobile proxy providers (e.g., Bright Data, Oxylabs).  
* **Architecture:** Modular, service-oriented design to separate the UI, scraping engine, and API.

### **6. Timeline & Milestones**

| Phase | Duration | Milestones |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 1: Core Engine** | 2-3 weeks | Basic static/dynamic scraping, CSV output. |
| **Phase 2: UI & UX** | 2 weeks | Build the web interface, Job Dashboard, and Recipe system. |
| **Phase 3: Data Destinations** | 1-2 weeks | Implement Google Sheets and PostgreSQL integrations. |
| **Phase 4: API & Webhooks** | 1-2 weeks | Build and secure the /api/scrape endpoint and webhook notification system. |
| **Phase 5: Testing & Deployment** | 1 week | End-to-end testing, user acceptance testing (UAT) with Dana and Mike, and internal deployment. |

### **7. Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk | Mitigation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **API Security Breach** | Implement API key authentication and rate limiting. |
| **Credential Management** | Securely store all database and API credentials using an encrypted vault service; do not hardcode them. |
| **Scope Creep** | Adhere strictly to the features outlined in this PRD for the initial release. New features will be considered for a V2. |
| **Website Anti-Bot Updates** | Dedicate ongoing maintenance time to monitor and update scraping and evasion techniques. |
| **High Operational Costs** | Implement the cost estimator and actively monitor proxy/service usage. |
