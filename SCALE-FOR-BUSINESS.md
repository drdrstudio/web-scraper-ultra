## 🏗️ Technical Architecture for Scale

### Current Architecture (1-100 users)
```
Single Server Setup:
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└──────┬──────┘

### Scalable Architecture (100-1000 users)

```yaml
Load Balancer (Cloudflare - $20/mo)

    ├── Cache Layer (Redis - 30% hit rate)
    │   └── Saves 30% of compute costs
    │
    ├── API Servers (2-4 instances)
    │   ├── Hetzner AX41: €39/mo each
    │   └── Auto-scaling based on load
    │
    ├── Queue System (RabbitMQ/Redis)
    │   └── Decouples API from workers
    │
    ├── Worker Pool (2-20 instances)
    │   ├── Process scraping jobs

### Infrastructure Costs by Scale

| Users | Infrastructure | Proxies | Services | Total/mo | Per User |
|-------|---------------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| 50 | $150 | $100 | $50 | $300 | $6.00 |
| 100 | $240 | $200 | $100 | $540 | $5.40 |
| 500 | $390 | $1,000 | $500 | $1,890 | $3.78 |
| 1000 | $800 | $2,000 | $1,000 | $3,800 | $3.80 |

### Critical Infrastructure Decisions

#### ✅ Use Hetzner/OVH, NOT AWS
```
AWS:     80TB bandwidth = $7,200/month
Hetzner: 80TB bandwidth = $0 (included)
Savings: $7,200/month
```

#### ✅ Implement Smart Proxy Routing
```python
def select_proxy(url):
    difficulty = assess_site_difficulty(url)
    
    if difficulty < 3:  # Easy sites (80%)
        return datacenter_proxy  # $0.001/request
    else:  # Hard sites (20%)
        return residential_proxy  # $0.01/request
    
    # Saves $30,000/month at scale
```

#### ✅ Aggressive Caching Strategy
```python
cache_rules = {
    'static_content': 24 * 3600,  # 24 hours
    'dynamic_content': 3600,      # 1 hour
    'user_specific': 300,         # 5 minutes
}

# 30% cache hit rate = 30% cost reduction
```
